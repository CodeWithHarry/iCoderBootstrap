    <h1 class="text-center mt-5">We Respect Your Privacy!</h1>

    <h2 class="text-center">We collect the following types of information about you:</h2> 
    
    <li>Information you provide us directly:</li>
    
    
    
    <p> We ask for certain information such as your username, real name, birthdate, address, phone number and e-mail address when you register for a iCoder account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Your username and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly. Once published your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed. </p>
    
    <li> Information we may receive from third parties: </li>
    
    <p>    We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the iCoder application, linking your account to the iCoder Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to iCoder. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join iCoder. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the iCoder Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.
    
    </p>
    
    
    <li> Analytics information:</li>
    
    <p> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.
    </p>
    <li> Cookies information: </li>
    
    <p>    Full details can be found on our Cookie Policy. When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets iCoder help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Full details can be found on our Cookie Policy.
    </p>
    <li> Log file information: </li>
    
    <p> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
    </p>
    
    <li>device identifiers:</li>
    
    <P>
    
    When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by iCoder. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
    </P>
    
    <li>Commercial and marketing communications:</li>
    
    
    <p>
    We use the information we collect or receive, such as your email address, to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions, and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related emails. You may also be able to be “found” on iCoder based on information that you provide (see “Find friends on iCoder”) above.
    </p>
    <li>Sharing of Your Information</li>
    <p>
    
    We will not rent or sell your information into third parties outside iCoder and its group companies (including any parent, subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted below:
    
        Who we may share your information with: We may share your information with third-party business partners and Trusted Users for the purpose of providing the Service to you. Third party business partners will be given limited access to your information as is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service, and we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy Policy, or operate under a similar privacy policy.
    
        Who can see User Content: Any User Content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service becomes available to the public and cannot be removed, except by iCoder in its sole discretion. Once posted on iCoder, User Content may not be removable from public view, as copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, on other sites that have republished us, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. If you do not wish your User Content to be available to the public, please don’t post it on iCoder. Your username and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly. Once published your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed.
    
        Who can see your IP address: If you post User Content on the Service while not logged in, your IP address will be published with your User Content in order to attribute your contribution to the Service. A selection of Trusted Users with administrative powers on iCoder have the ability to review IP addresses of users to reduce abusive behavior. Any third party service embedded on iCoder such as an advertiser, video provider, social network or other third party will also have access to your IP address.
    
        Who can see your email address: If you enter an email address, you will enable communication from iCoder and other Users. If you reply to users or participate in group iCoder activities such as meetups, your email address will be shared with these users. In addition, some email addresses such as blocked@iCoder.com forward to a group of Trusted Users, who will use your email address to reply to the email.
    </p>
    
    <li>
    Keeping your information safe:</li>
    <p>
    iCoder cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from iCoder, at all times. However, iCoder cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to iCoder or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the iCoder Service, such as social networks. iCoder is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.
    </p>
    
    <li>
    
    Compromise of information:
    </li>
    
    <p>
    In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, iCoder will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>
    
    <li>
    Links to Other Websites and Services
    </li>
    
    <p>
    We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Service, including the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on our website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and we do not control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service (like Facebook, Google groups, or an IRC chatroom) and you allow such a third-party access to you User Content you do so at your own risk. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Service.
